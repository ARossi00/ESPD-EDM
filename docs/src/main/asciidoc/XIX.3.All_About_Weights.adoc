** Each Criterion

The *SELF-CONTAINED ESPD*  caters for two methods of evaluating criteria (the REGULATED ESP does not covers this aspect).
These two methods are identified in the code list
link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/blob/master/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/cl/xlsx/ESPD-CodeLists-V2.0.2.xlsx[EvaluationMethodType] as
1) PASSFAIL (Pass or fail), and 2) WEIGHTED (the criterion is assigned a weight).

The ''pass or fail'' method is used in open procedures and in the first stage of multi-staged procedures. In multi-staged
procedures, once the list of candidates meeting the criteria have been selected, it makes sense to evaluate their tenders
based on weighted selection criteria.

Hence the following general rule should be applied by software applications dealing with the ESPD-EDM:

. If the procedure is open 1) no reduction of candidates is possible, and 2) criteria will not be weighted
(the value of the element cbc:EvaluationMethodTypeCode is to be set to `PASSFAIL`);

. Otherwise 1) the contracting authority should have the possibility of specifying the criteria and rules to be applied
in order to limit the number of candidates, and 2) it should have the possibility of assigning a weight to any selection
criterion (the value of the element cbc:EvaluationMethodTypeCode is to be set to `WEIGHTED`);

The data elements related to weighting is distributed in two different places of the UBL-2.2 XSD Schemas:

. At the root of the Qualification Application Request document (see section
link:https://espd.github.io/ESPD-EDM/v2.1.2/xml_guide.html##iii-4-root-elements[III.4 Root elements], see also
the UBL-2.2 Schema for the
link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/blob/master/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/xsdrt/maindoc/UBL-QualificationApplicationRequest-2.2-Pre-award.xsd[Qualification Application Request]
(the ESPD-Request document):

** Data element `cbc:WeightScoringMethodologyNote`, used for transparency motives: a text explaining clearly the
method that will be used to select those selection criteria that will be weighted is expected from the contracting
authority;

** Data element `cbc:WeightingTypeCode`, used to specify the type of the weighting (numeric, percentage).

. Inside the `cac:TenderingCriterion` class (see section IV. Criteria, common aspects
/link:https://espd.github.io/ESPD-EDM/v2.1.0/xml_guide.html#iv-1-general-behavior[IV.1 General behavior]:

** Data element `cbc:WeightNumeric`, used namely for ability and professional selection criteria in procedures
organised in two or multiple stages;

** Data element `cbc:EvaluationMethodTypeCode`, to inform about the type of Evaluation, namely for transparency purposes
(e.g. PASSFAIL, WEIGHTED), and

** Data element `cbc:WeightingConsiderationDescription`, used to hold additional information, comments or
considerations about the weighting and the evaluation method, namely for transparency purposes;
e.g. '0 Points 0 IT specialists, 30 Points 1 IT specialists, 60 Points 2 IT specialists'.

==== Mock-ups

The mock-up below illustrates how the contracting authority can specify weighted criteria and how the economic operator
could respond. For a complete example of how an XML instance of Request and Responses with weighted criteria see the
section link:https://espd.github.io/ESPD-EDM/v2.1.0/xml_guide.html#viii-7-3-xml-example-3-weighting[VIII.7.3 XML Example 3: Weighting].
