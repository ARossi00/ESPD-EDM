=== IX.2 All about lots

When a procurement procedure is divided in Lots not all the selection criteria apply to all Lots, i.e. some
Lots need to be linked to specific criteria.

In the SELF-CONTAINED ESPD-EDM specification, instead of defining criteria per each Lot, it is for the criterion to
specify to which Lots it applies.

To link a criterion with one or more Lots, the ESPD-EDM uses a GROUP (or SUBGROUP) of REQUIREMENT(s), where each REQUIREMENT
specifies the identifier of each Lot that is affected by the criterion. The figures below show how this is represented
in the four different criteria data structures listed above (''Suitability'', ''Professional risk indemnity'',
''Other economic or financial requirements'' and ''References'').

For more complete examples on how the SELF-CONTAINED ESPD-Request specifies these criteria see the
sub-sections
link:#vi-2-2-self-contained-suitability-enrolments[VI.2.2 Self-contained suitability (enrolments)],
link:#vi-6-2-self-contained-risk-indemnity-insurance[Self-contained risk indemnity insurance],
link:#vi-7-2-self-contained-other-economic-or-financial-requirements[VI.7.2 Self-contained other economic or financial requirements], and
link:#vi-8-2-self-contained-references[VI.8.2 Self-contained references].

See also the example illustrating how to respond in the case of
''References'' in the sub-section link:#viii-7-2-xml-example-2-references[VIII.7.2 XML Example 2: References].

The folder link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/tree/2.1.0/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/xml[dist/xml] also contains
complete XML instances of both REGULATED and SELF-CONTAINED ESPD-Request and ESPD-Response documents.


==== Lots: general information requirement check-list

. Applies only to SELF-CONTAINED ESPD-Request and ESDP-Response documents
. In principle could be applied to any selection criteria, but is only currently applied to these (see the
link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/blob/2.1.0/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/cl/xlsx/ESPD-CriteriaTaxonomy-SELFCONTAINED-V2.1.0.xlsx[Criteria Taxonomy spread-sheets]
for more details, like the Criterion description, UUID, Code, etc.):

    ** *Suitability I*
    *** Criterion #25 - Enrolment in a relevant professional register
    *** Criterion #26 - Enrolment in a trade register

    ** *Suitability II*
    *** Criterion #27 - For service contracts: authorisation of particular organisation needed
    *** Criterion #28 - For service contracts: membership of particular organisation needed

    ** *Professional risk insurance*
    *** Criterion #35 - Professional risk indemnity insurance

    ** *Other economic or financial requirements*
    *** Criterion #36 -Other economic or financial requirements

    ** *References*
    *** Criterion #37 - For works contracts: performance of works of the specified type
    *** Criterion #38 - For supply contracts: performance of deliveries of the specified type
    *** Criterion #39 - For service contracts: performance of services of the specified type

. Data elements ordered as expected in the ESPD-Response:
[cols="<1,<1,<2,<2,<2"]
|===
|*NÂº*|*Data Element*|*Description*|*Location*|*Rules*
|1
|*Procurement Procedure Lots*
|The Lots into which the procurement procedure has been divided into
|At the root of the QualificationApplicationResponse document, in the element `/cac:ProcurementProjectLot`
|Only the `cbc:ID` (the identifier of the lot) is required

|2
|*Criterion ''Lots the EO tenders to''*
|The Lots to which the economic operator tenders
|Inside a UBL-2.2 element `cac:TenderingCriterion`. This criterion has been defined by the ESPD-EDM (see
criterion #62 ''*Lots the EO tenders to*''. This criterion must occur just after `cac:ProcurementProjectLot`
|The Lots specified by the EO in its response must be coherent with the list of Lots specified by the CA (e.g. if the
CA has specified 5 Lots, the EO cannot tender to a ''Lot6'' (see row 1 of this table)

|3
|*CA's REQUIREMENT(s) and QUESTION(s) linked to specific Lots*
|One or more REQUERIMENT(s) and QUESTION(s) linking one criterion to the lots to which it applies (see XML examples)
|Inside a specific criterion, e.g. REQUIREMENTs defined in the ''Suitability'', ''Professional risk insurance'', ''Other economic
or financial requirements'' and ''References criteria''
|The Lots specified by the CA inside one REQUIREMENT must be coherent with the list of Lots into which the
procurement procedure is divided into (see row 1 or this table)

|4
|*EO's response on its Lots*
|List of the Lot Identifiers to which the EO tenders to
|Inside `/cac:TenderingCriterionResponse/cac:ResponseValue` (as `cbc:ResponseID`) used to, for example, respond to
specific CA's REQUIREMENT(s) related to Lots (see XML examples)
|The Lot identifiers provided by the EO must be coherent with the ones it (the EO) tenders to (see row 2 of this table)
