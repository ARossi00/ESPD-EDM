.Use of the EC's ESCO Taxonomy for skills, competences and occupations
[NOTE]
====
Notice that in the Data Structure above there is the field ''If possible please indicate the ESCO identifier for this
qualification'', and that the expected type of data is 'URL'.

ESCO is a multilingual classification that identifies and categorises skills, competences, qualifications and occupations
relevant for the EU labour market and education. It is being developed (maintained) by the European Commission
since 2010. The taxonomy can be downloaded from its link:https://ec.europa.eu/esco/portal[link].

The reason why the expected type of data is a URL is because in ESCO taxonomy each concept is identified with an IRI
IRI, standing for _Internationalized Resource Identifier_, is a generalisation of an URL allowing the use of Unicode).

ESCO is legally supported by the link:https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2016.107.01.0001.01.ENG[REGULATION (EU) 2016/589] of 13 April 2016
