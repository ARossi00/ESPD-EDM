==== Example 2: Risk indemnity insurance

===== Mock-up - contracting authority perspective

The contracting authority has selected the option *professional risk indemnity insurance* for its inclusion in the
ESPD-Request. Additionally, the contracting authority can specify REQUIREMENT(s) specific to the procurement procedure.

The contracting authority can require data from the economic operator in relation
to different types of insurances. When the procedure is divided into Lots, the contracting authority can specify
the Lots to which one particular insurance applies.

===== Mock-up - economic operator perspective

The only data the economic operator needs to provide is the amount covered by the insurance and the currency for that amount:

===== Criterion data structure

In this case (''Risk indemnity insurance'') there is one large REQUIREMENT_GROUP (with cardinality 1) that contains
a large REQUIREMENT_SUBGROUP that can be repeated *n* times. This REQUIREMENT_SUBGROUP contains the specific CA's
constraint that affect the Lots, in this case the CA's specifies two REQUIREMENT(s) herein: 1)a concrete type of
insurance, and 2) a minimum threshold for this type of insurance. This implies that the EO must subscribe this very
specific insurance for an amount greater than the one specified by the CA.

[NOTE]
====
*_If you wanted to apply the REQUIREMENT to all the Lots you could use the same trick that is used in the REGULATED ESPD:
1) refer only to one Lot, and 2) use the value `0` to identify it, thus meaning that all the lots of the procedure are
affected by this REQUIREMENT._*

*_This would prevent having to list every Lot, which is very convenient in procedures with dozens or hundreds of Lots._*
