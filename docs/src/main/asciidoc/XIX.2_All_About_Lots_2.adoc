==== Example 2: Risk indemnity insurance

===== Mock-up - contracting authority perspective

The contracting authority has selected the option *professional risk indemnity insurance* for its inclusion in the
ESPD-Request. Additionally, the contracting authority can specify REQUIREMENT(s) specific to the procurement procedure.

The contracting authority can require data from the economic operator in relation
to different types of insurances. When the procedure is divided into Lots, the contracting authority can specify
the Lots to which one particular insurance applies.

===== Mock-up - economic operator perspective

The only data the economic operator needs to provide is the amount covered by the insurance and the currency for that amount:

===== Criterion data structure

In this case (''Risk indemnity insurance'') there is one large REQUIREMENT_GROUP (with cardinality 1) that contains
a large REQUIREMENT_SUBGROUP that can be repeated *n* times. This repetitive SUBGROUP sets the identifier of one Lot
(and only one) and a series of REQUIREMENT(s) and QUESTION(s) that apply to that Lot. Notice that the link has to be
established only to one Lot, as each Lot has different properties (different REQUIREMENT(s) and QUESTION(s)).

==== Sets of data occurrence in the ESPD-Response

In the ESPD-Response, the instantiation of the elements follows this pattern (see also the
''Data elements ordered as expected in the ESPD-Response" in the table above).

* *_1st. SET OF DATA_*: Lots of the procurement procedure. See the XSD schema for the link:#viii-2-espd-request-xsd-schema[/cac:ProcurementProjectLot element]. This set of data is common to all teh ESPD-Request and ESPD-Response documents about procedures divided into lots;
* *_2nd. SET OF DATA_*: Lots to which the economic operator (EO) tenders to. See the data structure link:#lots-economic-operator-perspective[Lots tendered to] (Figure ''Figure 225. Lots tendered, data structure''). This set of data is common to all teh ESDP-Response documents about procedures divided into lots;
* *_3rd. SET OF DATA_*:
  ** CA's REQUIREMENTs: The CA specifies one or more

  ** Group of QUESTION(s) addressed to the EO related to the REQUIREMENT(s) above;
* *_4th. SET OF DATA_*: The responses provided by the EO, i.e. an answer for each QUESTION inside the GROUP of QUESTION(s).
