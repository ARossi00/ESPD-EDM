=== VI.2.2 Self-contained suitability (enrolments)

==== Mock-ups - contracting authority perspective

For each criteria regarding suitability, the CA should be able to provide: the register name, its URL and the Lots to which each requirement apply.

The mock-up below represents the requirements the CA should be able to specify for a suitability criterion in a procedure procurement that is *not divided into lots*:

This other mock-up represents the same situation when the procurement procedure is *divided into lots*. 

The contracting authority (CA) may request that the economic operator is registered in one or multiple registers. Per each register the CA specifies to which Lots this make sense. This behaviour of â€œone set of lots per *group of properties* is regular for all those selection criteria where the allocation of lots to a set of 'criterion properties' make sense (e.g. see the section "References").

==== Mock-ups - economic operator perspective

Notice that:

. The Lots and registers specified by the contracting authority are presented to the economic operator (on the left side of the mock-up, circles 1 to 6);	

. The expected answer is "Yes", meaning that the economic operator fulfills the criterion;

. In case of answering "No" the economic operator will have to provide the reasons why it is not registered.

==== Data Structure (Enrolments) - Self-contained

This data structure is quite different from the Regulated ESPD:

. It allows the definition of multiple national sub-criteria (to be retrieved from e-Certis): cardinality "0..n" of the SUBCRITERION group;

. It also allows the contracting authority to speciy multiple groups of REQUIREMENT(s) (in this case to specify which registers the economic operator should be registered in).

. The number of Lots is also multiple (notice the cardinality "1..n" of the LotID REQUIREMENT, thus making possible to build lists of LotsIDs.

. Regarding the groups of questions, notice that the main question is addressed to get the confirmation from the economic operator that it fulfills the criterion (if "Yes" the economic operator is registered). In case of answering "No" a sub-group of one QUESTION must be shown (the one asking the economic operator to provide the reason why it is not registered in the register specified by the contracting authority).
