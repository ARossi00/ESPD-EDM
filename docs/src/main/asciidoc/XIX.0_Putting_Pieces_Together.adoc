== IX Putting pieces together

The ESPD-EDM specification, notably the SELF-CONTAINED ESPD, defines different complex sets of data that are
distributed in different, and far-away, places of the corresponding XML instance.

Due to this complexity and scattering of related data structures, implementors of software dealing with the ESPD XML
instances may have a hard time to identify what needs to go in the XML instance and where.

This is the case of, specifically, the data related to 1) economic operators, 2) lots, and 3) weights.

To help implementors understand these topics and how to deal with them, the sub-sections of this chapter
illustrate how to put together the different sets of data related to each topic with abundant figures and comments.
