== IX Putting pieces together

REDO - Generalise for all sections 'ALL ABOUT...'

This section puts together everything that is related to procedures that are divided into multiple Lots. With this
purpose in mind the section first makes a summary of all the information requirements that are needed
(information requirement check-list), how they are represented (data structures) and how to put them together
(XML implementation).
